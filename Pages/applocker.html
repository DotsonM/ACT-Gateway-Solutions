<h1>ACT GATEWAY: AppLocker Considerations</h1>
<p>If your Testing Center is utilizing AppLocker policy to secure Windows devices, you may notice issues with ACT Gateway. Specifically, default AppLocker policies have been found to suppress a necessary script that runs during Device Checks on the machine during pretest validation and during testing sessions.</p>

<p>If you are applying Default AppLocker policies and you find that your Device Check is falsely returning a failed “Device Check” due to an outdated OS version, consider adding the AppLocker rule below to allow the check to properly process on the machine.</p>

<h2>AppLocker Rule to Add for Scripts</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click the “Script Rules” and choose “New Rule”.</li>
    <li>On the “Before you Begin” window, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>On the “Permissions” window, ensure the Action is set to <strong>Allow</strong> and the User or Group is <strong>Everyone</strong>, click <strong>Next</strong>.

    <li>On the “Path” window, enter <code>%OSDRIVE%\Users\*\appdata\local\Temp\*</code> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>On the “Exceptions” window, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>On the “Name” window, enter a name for the rule and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
    <li>Test the rule to ensure that ACT Gateway Device Check is now working.</li>
    <li>When ready, right-click on AppLocker, <strong>Export Policy</strong> and deploy to other Testing Center machines (likely done through Group Policy).
